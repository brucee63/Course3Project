## The following files were contributed by the student.
* 'README.md': This file, outlines all files used in this dataset analysis.
* 'CodeBook.md': Listing of variable names/labels, codes, formats, datatypes.
* 'run_analysis.R': R file responsible for creating a tidy dataset combining training and testing data, joining multiple data files together. Also creating a summary analysis.
  * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
